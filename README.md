# Multi-language NLP Bot Project

This project provides a template for building an NLP system for bots using Python, C++, C, C#, Go, and JavaScript, with data analysis and Triton Inference Server deployment support.

## Structure
- `python_nlp/` — Core NLP logic and data analysis (Python)
- `cpp_module/` — C++ integration sample
- `c_module/` — C integration sample
- `csharp_module/` — C# integration sample
- `go_module/` — Go integration sample
- `js_module/` — JavaScript integration sample
- `triton_deploy/` — Scripts/config for NVIDIA Triton Inference Server
- `.github/` — Copilot and project instructions

## Getting Started
1. Implement your NLP logic in `python_nlp/` (see sample provided).
2. Use integration samples to connect other languages (via REST/gRPC/shared libs).
3. Export models for deployment in `triton_deploy/`.
4. See each module's README for language-specific instructions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- C++17+ compiler
- Go 1.18+
- Node.js 16+
- .NET 6+
- NVIDIA Triton Inference Server (for deployment)

## Notes
- Replace sample code with your own logic as needed.
- For H/H++: Please clarify if you meant a specific language or framework.
